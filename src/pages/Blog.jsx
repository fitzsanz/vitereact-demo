          “Every step forward is a step closer to nature’s secret.”

           Day one took us deep into the lush wilderness of Barangay Ricoro, Gingoog City, where Ricoro Falls awaits after an unforgettable 10-kilometer trek. The journey was long, winding through dense greenery and rugged trails, but every drop of sweat was worth it. Along the way, we were greeted by the melodies of forest birds and the soft crunch of leaves beneath our feet. Once we reached the falls, the sound of crashing water was like music after the silence of the trail. Hidden deep in nature, Ricoro Falls offered us a moment of peace that made the entire hike feel like a pilgrimage.

          Our second day led us to Manibay Falls, nestled in Sitio Manibay, Claveria—a breathtaking destination that tested both our courage and determination. To get there, we had to cross a dangerous river, its current swift and unpredictable, challenging every step with uncertainty. But with teamwork and care, we made it across, and what greeted us was beyond imagination—a powerful cascade hidden behind wild vines and ancient rocks. The danger we faced made the moment even more surreal. Manibay Falls was more than a sight; it was a victory earned through bravery.

          Our final day brought us to the towering beauty of Lantawon Falls in Sitio Lantawon, Claveria. This leg of the adventure demanded strength as we climbed through steep, high terrain just to catch a glimpse of its hidden grandeur. Each incline pushed our limits, with every rock and tree root a step closer to the top. But reaching the falls felt like standing at nature’s throne—an isolated haven where water danced from the cliffs like silver threads. Surrounded by towering trees and mist-kissed air, Lantawon Falls was a climactic end to our journey, a waterfall we had to earn with effort and awe.
